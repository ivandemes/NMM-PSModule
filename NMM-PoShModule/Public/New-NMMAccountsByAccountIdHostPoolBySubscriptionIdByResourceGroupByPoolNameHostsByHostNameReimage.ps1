    <#
.SYNOPSIS
Reimage host
.DESCRIPTION
## Notes
- Size: VM size of newly created session hosts. The most popular session host VM families are Dsv3 and Esv3. 
Examples of sizes for this field: Standard_B1ls, Standard_D2_v3.
- Image: Desktop Image id to be used as the golden image for newly created session hosts. You can use existing one, or create new. Examples of images: MicrosoftWindowsDesktop/Windows-10/win10-22h2-avd/latest,
MicrosoftWindowsDesktop/Office-365/19h2-evd-o365pp/latest.
- StorageType and DiskSize: OS Disk type and size of newly created session hosts. Must be equal to or larger than the size of the Desktop Image selected above.
Using Standard HDD(S-type) disks is not recommended. Premium SSD provides best performance. StorageType varieties: Standard_LRS, Premium_LRS, StandardSSD_LRS, UltraSSD_LRS.
- HasEphemeralOSDisk: Ephemeral OS disks are created on the local virtual machine (VM) storage and not saved to the remote Azure Storage. 
An Ephemeral OS disk is stored on local storage and is therefore faster and free, but it is not persistent. 
It is therefore only used in situations where the VM is based on an image and every time it is started the OS disk will get “regenerated” from 
the generalized image and any changes made to the OS disk (C:) will be lost if the VM moves to another host or is reallocated. 
- Schedule: With the schedule set to null action will be performed immediately. With schedule turned ON and specified, the task will be 
performed according to the specified schedule. Can be null.
    - Id: Schedule id to edit. Can be null.
    - ProfileId: Global or Account schedule profile id. Can be null.
    - DisplayName: Friendly name of the schedule.
    - StartDate: Start date when operation can begin.
    - StartHour and StartMinute: Start time when operation can begin.
    - TimeZoneId: Enter your time zone or use UTC.
    - ScheduleRecurrenceType: Specify whether to run this operation once or repeat it on recurring schedule.
    - WeeklySettings: Specify in case of ScheduleRecurrenceType = Weekly.
        - Days: Days of week when the task will repeat.
        - Period: Period in weeks when the task will repeat. If Period is equal 1, the task will repeat every week.
    - MonthlySettings: Specify in case of ScheduleRecurrenceType = Monthly.
        - MultiDaysMode: 
            - Days: Specific days of month when the task will repeat.
        - SingleDayMode: 
            - DayOfWeekNumber: The task will repeat every month on this day. 
            E.g. you want to repeat this operation monthly every Second Friday, then you choose DayOfWeekNumber = Second, DayOfWeek = Friday.
            - DayOfWeek: The task will run on this day of week.
        - Period: Period in months when the task will repeat. If Period is equal 1, the task will repeat every month.
